                                In my working life, I was the Foundation Professor of Management at University of South
                                Australia (now Adelaide University). My research has mainly focused on leadership as has
                                my teaching. My other interests are time with my husband and my family, particularly those
                                grandchildren, traveling in regional and remote Australia, time with friends, gardening,
                                and crafty things.

                                I have always had an interest in people, talking with them, wanting to understand their life,
                                story, and what makes them happy and/or sad. Just getting to know them.

                                The <strong>Chat Seats</strong> initiative, while not a new idea, is a great opportunity to connect

                                Noel experienced extreme loneliness for most of his life, including throughout the entirety
                                of a twenty-year stint in the Army. A chance conversation set him on the path to making
                                some important life choices, including in his case the need to take the first important step
                                    of forgiveness.
