                            <strong> Chat Seats</strong> across Australia. The <strong>Chat Seats initiative </strong>
                            aims to provide a safe and inviting place for people to talk. It will allow members
                        of the community to <strong> "Connect through Conversation." </strong>
                            For this initiative to be successful, we need people like yourselves to volunteer
                            to be either <strong>Listeners</strong> and/or <strong>Coordinators</strong>.

                                Listeners are individuals who volunteer their time to sit on a Chat Seat and listen to members of the community who may join them.
                                Some of these members of the community may also be lonely and/or isolated.
                                We are hoping to connect them back into their community through conversation.

                                Someone who enjoys listening to other people and is interested in what is happening for them.
                                Also, someone who has a couple of hours each week where they would like to sit at one of our Chat Seat locations.
                                Does this sound like you?

                                Coordinators are individuals who are also volunteers and may also choose to be Listeners.
                                They will help to establish a site and support the Listeners.
                                So, who would be a good Coordinator? Someone who enjoys negotiating with potential venue "managers" and has good organisational skills.
